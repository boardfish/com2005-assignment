# Abstract

The paper follows the creation of a model for the representation of forest fires on a given area of land. Forest fires can happen regularly in certain conditions and areas of land, and are known to cause significant damage. Therefore, it is important to be able to visualise their impact in order to be able to counteract potential damage. Our commissioners have means of mitigating further damage that this simulation could represent.

The simulation uses Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automata structure in which neighbouring cells' states  can change based on how many are 'alive' or 'dead', and adapts it for several states. These represent types of ground, and how the cell is affected by fire. Other factors such as wind speed, flammability and burn time are determined for each type of ground.

Using the simulation we were able to predict and select solutions to several problems. The start points used were those of a proposed incinerator and a power plant. Problems ranged from determining the relative time for fires to reach the town based on the wind direction, and how to protect against this either by using aerial drops of water or extending the dense forest area.
